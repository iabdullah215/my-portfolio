Creative, passionate, and self-taught individual with a love for Offensive Security, DevSecOps, Development, Reverse Engineering, Penetration Testing, Red Teaming and CTFs. Willing to work with others in the hopes of learning new things and creatively providing solutions to complex problems and collaborating with them.

By day, I'm a coffee-fueled coder and nerd, hammering out lines of code like there's no tomorrow. But when the sun sets, the real fun begins. I don my virtual cape, pull on my digital gloves, and dive deep into the cyber-verse. I'm not just a hacker — I safeguard the digital landscape.

I dance through encryption like it's a rhythm game, always two steps ahead of the cyber crooks. Don't worry, though — I mostly focus on keeping things secure.

In this age of digital goldmines, I'm the silent protector, watching over your data while you sleep. If there's a breach to be patched or a botnet to be busted, you can count on me. So if you need a partner in code or just someone to talk shop about the latest infosec trends, I'm your go-to. Here's to being a keyboard ninja by night and a security enthusiast by day!
