![Back](/static/images/back.jpg)

Creative, passionate, and self-taught individual with a love for *Offensive Security*, *Penetration Testing*, *Red Teaming*, *Reverse Engineering*, *CTFs* and *Little bit of Crypto*. Willing to work with others in the hopes of learning new things and creatively providing solutions to complex problems and collaborating with them.

By day, I'm a coffee-fueled coder and nerd, hammering out lines of code like there's no tomorrow. But when the sun sets, the real fun begins. I don my virtual cape, pull on my digital gloves, and dive deep into the cyber-verse. I'm not just a hacker — I safeguard the digital landscape.

I dance through encryption like it's a rhythm game, always two steps ahead of the cyber crooks. Don't worry, though — I mostly focus on keeping things secure.

In this age of digital goldmines, I'm the silent protector, watching over your data while you sleep. If there's a breach to be patched or a botnet to be busted, you can count on me. So if you need a partner in code or just someone to talk shop about the latest infosec trends, I'm your go-to. Here's to being a keyboard ninja by night and a security enthusiast by day!
