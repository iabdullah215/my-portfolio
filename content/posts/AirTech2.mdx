## Let's get Cracking...

## Challenge 02: tttcccppp

Was a tricky yet interesting challenge to solve.

In this challenge again a `.pcap` file was given in order to solve the challenge and a hint was given as well.

``` hint

why would someone send data in the first part of the TCP handshake

```

A `TCP` handshake looks like this.

So, I used the TCP filter to filter out the `TCP` traffic.

After that when I examined every `SYN` packet they had an alphabet in them.

As you can see they are forming the first four alphabets of the flag i.e. `AT24` So I carried on with the search and finally, I got the whole flag.

Flag: `AT24{TTTCCCPPP_15_R3liable}`
