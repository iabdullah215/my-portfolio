I started my ICCA exam prep on June 25, 2024 and gave my exam on July 7, 2024. And received a much awaited email the same day stating:

`Hello Abdullah, Congratulations on receiving your INE Certified Cloud Associate Certification`

## Background:

I was basically preparing for the **eJPT** exam and was waiting for the right discount to buy the voucher. When the June Sale arrived I thought this is the right time to buy the **INE Fundamentals Annual**. At that time it was coming with free **eJPT** and **ICCA** exam vouchers. So without any further a do I bought the **INE Fundamentals Annual** bundle.

So, after I bought the bundle I kept my **eJPT** prep on hold for a few days and started the preparation for **ICCA**. I took the preparation seriously because I didn’t wanted to waste this chance.

## About the exam:

The [INE Certified Cloud Associate](https://ine.com/learning/certifications/internal/icca-ine-certified-cloud-associate) certification serves as an entry-level accreditation, providing a comprehensive overview of fundamental cloud computing principles.

What sets this certification apart is its vendor-neutral approach, steering clear of tying candidates to a single provider like AWS or Azure.
Instead, the course covers general cloud concepts and their implementation across the three major cloud platforms:

- Amazon (AWS)
- Microsoft (Azure)
- Google (GCP)

As one of the few, if not the only, entry-level multi-cloud courses with both theoretical and hands-on components, it covers essential concepts and practical aspects across the three leading cloud providers.

## Preparation:

For my preparation I choose the provided **ICCA Learning Path**. The course was okay. I wouldn’t say it was the most impressive one out there but it was enough to make you exam ready. It covered the following topic:

- Cloud Basics
- Cloud Deployment Models
- Cloud Management
- Cloud Shared Responsibility Model
- Cloud Services & Providers
- Cloud Identity & Access Management (IAM)

It took me around 10 days to complete the whole learning path. I was studying two to three hours at night along side 9 to 5 onsite internship in the day. So, yes I guess 10 days is still pretty fast xD.

## Pros & Cons:

**Pros:**
- Short course (16h) compared to other INE courses (eJPTv2 is 156h!).
- ICCA now includes free access to AWS/Azure/GCP to practice the labs.
- **Tracy Wallace** is a highly knowledgeable and engaging instructor with a great sense of humor. You won’t get bored of him.
- The course effectively guides you from a basic to a solid understanding of foundational cloud knowledge.
- Additionally, the open-book exam allows you to refer to your notes or cloud provider documentation.

**Cons:**
- The included slides lack substantial material coverage, with approximately 80% of the content being verbally explained and presented on a whiteboard by Tracy Wallace.
- Consequently, a concerted effort is needed to actively listen and meticulously note down the crucial concepts he explains.
- Some questions in the exam caught me off guard, and I couldn’t recall them being covered in the course material. Fortunately, my preparation involved going through supplementary resources, which proved beneficial, along with consulting the appropriate vendor documentation.
